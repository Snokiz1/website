    <p>
        During my internship at Rize, a Proptech company based in Riyadh, I worked as a Data Science Intern, where I gained valuable industry experience in data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence. This internship allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world problems, particularly in analyzing real estate data to develop predictive models that enhance property market insights. I worked with tools such as Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL, and Tableau, which helped me improve my ability to process and analyze large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to the fast-paced nature of the industry and handling unstructured data. Unlike academic projects, real-world datasets are often messy and require extensive data cleaning before any meaningful analysis can be conducted. To overcome this, I researched best practices in data preprocessing and collaborated with senior data scientists to improve my understanding of data pipelines. Another challenge was integrating machine learning models into business decisions. I learned that the key to solving this was not just technical skills but also the ability to communicate findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this experience, I significantly enhanced my technological competency by utilizing IT tools for problem-solving and decision-making. I also developed my critical thinking competency by improving my ability to gather, process, and analyze information to make data-driven business decisions. Additionally, I gained valuable insights into professionalism by learning how to efficiently perform tasks in an industry setting, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and adapt to corporate work culture. My performance level during this internship was intermediate because while I successfully executed tasks and solved problems, I also realized there is still room for growth in optimizing data models and making them more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        For those considering an internship in data science, my advice is to focus on developing strong foundations in data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization. Additionally, learning to communicate your analytical findings effectively is just as important as technical expertise. Finally, networking with industry professionals and seeking mentorship can provide valuable career insights. This internship has reinforced my passion for data science and prepared me for future professional challenges in the Proptech industry.
