        The Current and Future Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Society was a research assignment completed for COMM 1312 - Writing and Research. The competencies demonstrated in this assignment include COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY, TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETENCY, and CRITICAL THINKING COMPETENCY. Three key indicators of success from different competencies were: accessing needed information, using IT tools for research and decision-making, and developing and reasonably defending arguments, positions, and decisions. My standard of performance for these competencies was at an intermediate level because I was able to successfully gather, analyze, and present information effectively, but there are still areas for improvement in critical evaluation and synthesis of data.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this research assignment, I explored how Artificial Intelligence (AI) influences various aspects of society, including its impact on employment, healthcare, education, and economic growth. Through this study, I enhanced my ability to access and critically evaluate information, effectively use IT tools for research, and develop logical arguments supported by credible sources. The process involved extensive literature review and analysis of scholarly articles discussing the positive and negative implications of AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the main challenges I faced during this assignment was filtering through vast amounts of data to find relevant and credible sources. Given the evolving nature of AI, many articles contained speculative claims, making it difficult to discern factual information from opinion. I overcame this by prioritizing peer-reviewed sources and cross-referencing information for accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another challenge was structuring my arguments in a coherent manner while maintaining a logical flow. To address this, I created an outline before drafting the paper, ensuring that each section contributed effectively to the overall argument. My advice to future students working on similar assignments is to start early, refine research questions, and use reputable sources. Additionally, using tools such as reference management software can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy in citation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, my performance in this research assignment was at an intermediate level due to my ability to gather and analyze information, utilize technological tools, and construct well-supported arguments. However, there is room for improvement in synthesizing complex ideas concisely and enhancing the depth of critical evaluation. Overcoming the challenges of filtering data and structuring arguments helped me develop stronger communication, technological, and critical thinking skills, which will be beneficial for future research endeavors.
