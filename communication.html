        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>  Communication Definition :
            (Write around 80 -100 words).
            Communication is the process of exchanging ideas, information, and feelings 
            through various methods, including verbal, non-verbal, and written forms. Effective 
            communication involves not only the transmission of a message but also active 
            listening and appropriate feedback to ensure mutual understanding. It is essential for
            building relationships, resolving conflicts, and fostering collaboration in both personal
            and professional environments. Good communication requires clarity, empathy, and 
            adaptability to different contexts and audiences, making it a critical skill in all aspects
            of life.
             REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 1st ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            Cultural Clash in Room 207 assignment was part of the Oral Communication 
            Competency in the Communication Skills course. I will evaluate my performance 
            using indicator number 4: Prepares effective written and oral communication. In 
            this assignment, I would rate myself at an intermediate level in oral communication.
            The task involved writing and performing a short skit demonstrating how cultural 
            differences among roommates can lead to conflict and how understanding and 
            communication can resolve these issues. The scene was developed collaboratively, 
            and each member contributed to the script, highlighting the cultural perspectives of 
            the characters.
            One of the difficulties I faced in this assignment was understanding how to represent 
            the nuances of each culture in a respectful yet engaging manner. To overcome this, I
            researched different cultural practices regarding sharing and personal space and 
            incorporated that into the dialogue, citing sources like Smith et al. (2021) and Chen 
            and Lee (2020). My biggest challenge was the live presentation aspectâ€”delivering 
            
            my lines confidently while keeping the audience engaged. I practiced by rehearsing 
            several times with my group and received feedback on my tone and body language.
            This assignment taught me the importance of clear communication in resolving 
            conflicts, particularly in multicultural environments. My advice to future students 
            would be to practice thoroughly and engage with the content, as this will help make 
            the presentation smoother and more convincing.</p>

            REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 2nd ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            For my Research Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) assignment in the Writing 
            and Research COMM 1312 course, I will evaluate myself using indicator number 1: 
            Determines the nature and extent of information needs. I believe I performed at 
            an advanced level in this aspect. The assignment involved researching the current 
            and future societal impacts of AI, evaluating both the positive and negative 
            consequences of this rapidly evolving technology. I chose this topic because of its 
            relevance and complexity, which pushed me to dive deeply into a wide range of 
            academic sources.
            The main challenge I encountered was synthesizing a large amount of information 
            from various sources. I found it difficult to organize the data effectively, but I 
            overcame this obstacle by using structured outlines and focusing on key themes, 
            such as AI's impact on employment, education, and healthcare. By analyzing studies
            from Bryson (2019) and Acemoglu (2021), I developed a nuanced understanding of 
            the subject. This helped me present a balanced argument that highlighted both the 
            opportunities AI offers and the potential threats it poses to society.
            The assignment honed my research and writing skills, particularly in critical analysis 
            and source integration. My advice to future students tackling similar assignments is 
            to start early, organize your research carefully, and ensure you use credible sources 
            to back your arguments.</p>
