        <p> Technology Definition :
            (Write around 80 -100 words).
            Technology involves the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, 
            especially in industries. It allows individuals and organizations to solve problems, 
            communicate, and increase productivity through the use of tools, systems, and 
            software. In the field of Information Technology (IT), technology is essential for 
            research, decision-making, and addressing complex challenges. It continues to evolve,
            impacting all aspects of society, from healthcare to business, and its implications often
            raise important ethical considerations regarding privacy and security.
             REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 1st ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            For the Task 1 assignment in Computer Science 2, I worked on developing a Java-
            based application. This assignment contributed to the Technology Competency by 
            highlighting the success indicator of Uses IT tools for productivity, communication,
            research, problem-solving, and decision making. My performance level was 
            intermediate because I was able to successfully complete the core requirements of the
            project, but I recognized areas where I could improve, particularly in code 
            optimization and exception handling.
            In this assignment, I was tasked with developing a Java program using object-oriented
            programming principles and error handling. This helped me gain valuable experience 
            in working with Java IDEs and debugging tools. A specific challenge I faced was 
            managing exceptions effectively to ensure the program ran smoothly without 
            unexpected errors. I overcame this obstacle by conducting research, reading Java 
            documentation, and watching video tutorials to learn best practices in exception 
            handling. This improved my ability to troubleshoot and debug my code. My advice for
            others would be to thoroughly plan out the structure of the code before starting, as it 
            helps in minimizing errors during development. This project strengthened my 
            understanding of problem-solving and highlighted the importance of writing clean, 
            maintainable code in larger programming projects.</p>

        <p>REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 2nd ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            For the Lab 5 assignment in Web Programming, I focused on creating a responsive 
            navigation menu using CSS. This project showcased my understanding of the 
            Technology Competency, specifically under the success indicator of problem-
            solving and decision-making. My performance level was advanced, as I successfully
            implemented a design that adapted well to both large and small screens, ensuring 
            usability and responsiveness across devices.
            The goal of the assignment was to create a fully functional navigation bar that adjusts 
            based on screen size using CSS flexbox and media queries. One challenge I 
            encountered was maintaining the visual appeal and functionality of the navigation bar 
            on smaller devices, like mobile phones. I tackled this issue by experimenting with 
            different CSS properties, such as adjusting the flexbox layout and ensuring the 
            elements had appropriate spacing. I also used media queries to change the layout for 
            smaller screens, ensuring a smooth transition between screen sizes. My advice to 
            others is to use a mobile-first design approach because it simplifies making the design 
            responsive later on. This project solidified my understanding of responsive web design
            and the importance of considering user experience across different devices, helping 
            me develop strong problem-solving skills for future web development tasks.</p>
