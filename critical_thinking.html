        <p>Critical Thinking Definition :
            (Write around 80 -100 words).
            Critical thinking is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information objectively, 
            leading to well-reasoned conclusions and decisions. It involves questioning assumptions, 
            identifying biases, and considering various perspectives before forming a judgment. Critical 
            thinkers approach problems with curiosity, open-mindedness, and skepticism, using logic 
            and evidence to assess the validity of arguments or ideas. This skill is essential for solving 
            complex problems, making informed decisions, and navigating the vast amount of 
            information available today. It encourages a reflective and analytical mindset, fostering more 
            thoughtful and reasoned actions.
             REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 1st ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            Assignment Name: Analyzing Apple's iPhone Ad
            Competency: Critical Thinking Competency
            Course Name: UNIV 1212: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
            Indicator of Success: Gathers and processes information for decision-making, Clarifies 
            problems and develops effective solutions.
            Standard of Performance: Intermediate
            Reflecting on the first assignment, I found the process of analyzing Apple’s new iPhone 
            advertisement both engaging and insightful. This task required not only attention to the visual
            and auditory elements of the ad but also a deep dive into its underlying marketing strategies. 
            Through this analysis, I realized how advertisements are carefully crafted to appeal to 
            specific emotions and demographics. The use of vibrant colors, fast-paced visuals, and an 
            energetic soundtrack effectively captured attention, making the ad both engaging and 
            memorable. I particularly appreciated the synchronization between the music and the visuals, 
            which enhanced the overall appeal.
            This assignment also encouraged me to think critically about the target audience. While 
            initially, I thought the advertisement aimed at a broad audience, I later understood that it 
            targets tech-savvy individuals, likely between their teens and middle age, who are eager to 
            upgrade their devices. Apple’s ability to make their products appear desirable through simple 
            yet sophisticated ads became clear.
            Moreover, the exercise of questioning the honesty of the advertisement helped me realize the 
            importance of transparency in marketing. Apple, in this instance, seemed to be forthright by 
            focusing on product features without overpromising, which enhances trust in the brand. This 
            
            reflection has increased my appreciation for the strategic thinking behind ads and their ability
            to influence purchasing decisions.
            In conclusion, this assignment allowed me to enhance my skills in observation and analysis. 
            It also underscored the significance of understanding the subtle techniques advertisers use to 
            appeal to consumers. Overall, the experience deepened my awareness of how marketing 
            impacts consumer behavior and the importance of maintaining honesty in branding.</p>

        <p> REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON 2nd ASSIGNMENT:
            (Write around 300 - 350 words)
            Assignment Name: Capital Punishment Comparison Essay
            Competency: Critical Thinking Competency
            Course Name: UNIV 1212: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
            Indicator of Success: Develops and reasonably defends arguments, positions, and decisions.
            Standard of Performance: Advanced
            Reflecting on the second assignment, which required a comparison of two argument essays 
            on capital punishment, I found the exercise to be both challenging and enlightening. This task
            pushed me to engage deeply with the contrasting views and evaluate the strengths and 
            weaknesses of each side. The first argument, which supports capital punishment, was well-
            supported by data, statistics, and moral reasoning that emphasized justice through retribution 
            and deterrence. This approach provided a clear and logical framework, especially when 
            referencing examples from countries like Singapore and Britain, where capital punishment 
            has reportedly lowered crime rates.
            On the other hand, the second argument, opposing capital punishment, focused on moral and 
            humanitarian grounds, stressing the value of human life and the potential for errors in the 
            justice system. The use of analogies, such as the suffering of the defendant’s family and the 
            inhumanity of knowing the time of one’s death, brought an emotional and ethical dimension 
            to the discussion. This perspective highlighted the irreversible nature of executions and the 
            potential for innocent lives to be lost, which made me reflect more critically on the moral 
            implications of such an irreversible punishment.
            Comparing these two arguments allowed me to see how different forms of reasoning—
            whether based on practical statistics or moral philosophy—can shape a debate. I realized the 
            importance of not only presenting evidence but also appealing to the audience's ethical 
            sensibilities. This assignment also helped me appreciate the complexity of controversial 
            issues like capital punishment, where both sides have valid points that need careful 
            consideration.
            In conclusion, this reflection has sharpened my analytical skills and deepened my 
            understanding of argumentative structure. The assignment underscored the importance of 
            impartiality and justice in legal matters, while also reminding me that societal decisions must 
            weigh both practical outcomes and ethical principles.</p>
